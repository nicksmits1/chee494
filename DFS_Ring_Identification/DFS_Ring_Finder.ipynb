    "### <b> Definition of Gas Hydrates </b>\n",
    "Gas hydrates, also known as clathrate hydrates, are crystalline water-based solids that are physically similar to ice. However, unlike ice they form under specific conditions of low temperature (typically below 0°C / 273K) and high pressure (NUMBER), commonly found in deep ocean sediments and permafrost regions (https://doi.org/10.1021/ie00019a001) (https://water.lsbu.ac.uk/water/clathrate_hydrates.html#:~:text=Clathrate%20hydrate%20crystalline%20ices%20b,pressure%20raises%20the%20melting%20point). Gas hydrates form polyhedron \"cage\" structures via hydrogen bonds between collections of water molecules. These structures encapsulate small non-polar gas molecules like methane, ethane, propane, carbon dioxide, or hydrogen sulfide within cages of hydrogen-bonded water molecules. This encapsulation property allows for a large volume of guest gas to be stored within a smaller volume of host hydrate, subsequently leading to the material's use in fields including gas separation, CO<sub>2</sub> storage, energy storage, seawater desalination and energy storage. The stability of gas hydrates depends on temperature, pressure, and the type of gas involved, with different structures (I, II, and H) forming based on the size of the encapsulated molecules (https://doi.org/10.1002/bbpc.19540580105). Without the presence of either host molecules or the correct conditions, gas hydrates decompose to crystalline ice or liquid water. Clathrates have been found in nature in large quantities, with approximately 6.4 trillion tonnes of methane sequestered in deposits located on the deep ocean floor including the Norwegian Continental Shelf or permafrost regions of the northwestern Canadian arctic (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2004.09.005). Consequently, these are seen as a potential future energy resource due to their high methane content, but they also pose climate risks as their destabilization could release methane, a potent greenhouse gas (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.12.061). \n",
    "\n",
    "### <b> Gas Hydrate Geometries </b>\n",
    "Gas hydrates form structures which are classified into 3 types: I, II and H, all of which are crystallographic cubic structures. Structures I and II are commonly referred to as sI and sII. The figure below summarizes the different categorizations for each cage type.\n",

    "(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clathrate_hydrate#cite_note-16)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cage Types\n",
    "The type categorization arises from the number of water molecules in the unit cell. Type I consists of a unit cell 46 water molecules. Type II unit cells are formed from 136 water molecules. Type H is made up of 36 water molecules in the unit cell.\n",
    "(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clathrate_hydrate#cite_note-16)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Type I\n",
    "Type I structures are made up of two distinct cages. The small cage structure, also common to all 3 types, is a pentagonal dodecahedron known as the 5<sup>12</sup> structure (left-hand side of each row in figure). The large structure associated with this type is (and only this type) is a tetradecahedron formed from 2 hexagonal and 12 pentagonal faces, known as a 6<sup>2</sup>5<sup>12</sup> (right-most of first row in figure). A typical unit cell consists of two small and six large cages which can be replicated to form larger repetitions of the structure. Type I structures typically host CO<sub>2</sub> or CH<sub>4</sub> molecules.\n",
    "(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clathrate_hydrate#cite_note-16)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Type II\n",
    "Type II structures are made up of two distinct cages, small and large, much like Type I. This structure consists of sixteen small and eight large cages. The small cage is the 5<sup>12</sup> cage, equivalent to Type I, while the large cage is a hexadecahedron, known as 6<sup>4</sup>5<sup>12</sup> (middle of 2nd row in figure), consisting of 4 hexagonal and 12 pentagonal faces. Type II hydrates typically host gases such as oxygen, O<sub>2</sub>, and nitrogen, N<sub>2</sub>.\n",
    "(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clathrate_hydrate#cite_note-16)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Type H \n",
    "Type H structures are made of a small cage, an intermediate cage and a \"huge \"cage. The small cage is the 5<sup>12</sup> cage. The intermediate cage is a 6<sup>3</sup>5<sup>6</sup>4<sup>3</sup> structure formed from 3 square, 6 pentagonal, and 3 hexagonal faces (middle of bottom row). The final \"huge\" cage in the Type H structure consists of a 6<sup>8</sup>5<sup>12</sup> cage, with the corresponding number of pentagonal and hexagonal faces (left-most of bottom row in figure). Unlike Types I and II, Type H requires the cooperation of two guest gas molecules, one large and one small, while the \"huge\" cage allows for large molecules such as butane to be hosted. The gasses filling the smaller cages support the larger cavities.\n",

    "### <b> Gas Hydrate Formation </b>\n",
    "Hydrate nucleation typically occurs at the vapor–liquid interface, molecular models have concentrated on this surface. The earliest model, the labile cluster mechanism, describes unstable clusters of a guest molecule surrounded by 20 to 28 water molecules (depending on the hydrate structure). These clusters can form on either side of the interface and grow to a critical size, initiating nucleation. A modified labile cluster model involves adsorption and clustering on the vapor side of the interface. Another recent mechanism, the local structuring hypothesis, focuses on the arrangement of guest molecules and hydrogen-bonded water networks similar to hydrates.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible that hydrate nucleation involves a combination of these mechanisms and is analogous to ice formation, as suggested by MD simulations showing long-lived hydrogen bonds forming a compact nucleus, which then expands and freezes the system. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Labile Cluster Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "The labile cluster nucleation hypothesis proposes that water clusters around dissolved gas molecules can grow to a critical radius. The pertinent stages of this nucleation process comprise several conceptual stages. Initially, pure water has transient, labile ring structures of pentagons and hexagons. Then water forms clusters around dissolved gases, with the cluster size depending on the gas type. Coordination numbers for natural gas components vary, e.g., methane (20), ethane (24), propane (28), etc (https://doi.org/10.1201/9781420008494). These clusters combine to form different unit cells, depending on the coordination of the cluster formed around guest molecules (https://doi.org/10.1201/9781420008494). Once a critical radius has been achieved, steady growth will begin (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237824099_Hydrate_Formation_and_CH_4_Production_from_Natural_Gas_Hydrates_-_Emphasis_on_Boundary_Conditions_and_Production_Methods). However, several factors hinder the nucleation kinetics before a critical radius is achieved due to the increase in activation barrier energy. The main kinetics hindering effect present is the transformation of different structure types transforming into one or the other following cluster formation. Additionally, this transformation process allows for different structure formation pathways which increases the barrier to nucleation (though this has been scrutinized) (https://doi.org/10.1201/9781420008494). The transformation process is influenced by the gas type. For example, ethane's transformation of empty cavities is rapid, while for propane, it is slower due to fewer cavities.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Nucleation at the Interface Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "The nucleation at the interface hypothesis is a theory of gas hydrate formation proposed by Long and Kvamme based on the idea that nucleation occurs at the vapor side of the interface (https://doi.org/10.1201/9781420008494). Thus, this suggests that the nucleation is heterogeneous and consists of several stages. Gas molecules move to the interface at a characteristic rate of 10<sup>22</sup> molecules/cm<sup>2</sup>s, indicating the transport of molecules through a stagnant boundary. Next, gas adsorbs onto the aqueous surface into partially formed cavities. Following adsorption, the gas migrates to suitable sites on the surface where water molecules form partial and then complete cages around the adsorbed gas. Labile clusters grow on the vapor side until they reach a critical size, either by adding water and gas molecules to existing cavities or by joining cavities (https://doi.org/10.1201/9781420008494).\n",
    "\n",
    "The hypothesis envisions a dynamic process with numerous clusters forming and dissolving rather than an orderly progression from small clusters to large hydrate masses (https://doi.org/10.1201/9781420008494).\n",

    "#### Local Structuring Nucleation Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "Recent molecular simulations have investigated the nucleation of gas hydrates in bulk water phase as well as the water-hydrocarbon interface, support the local structuring hypothesis over the labile cluster model (https://doi.org/10.1201/9781420008494). Radhakrishnan and Trout (2002) used Landau free energy calculations to study carbon dioxide hydrate nucleation. Their findings showed that labile clusters are more likely to disintegrate than to agglomerate, suggesting that nucleation occurs via local structuring (https://doi.org/10.1201/9781420008494). This was characterized by thermal fluctuations followed by the formation of a critical nucleus. Guest molecules (such as CO<sub>2</sub>) arrange in configurations similar to the clathrate hydrate phase, causing local perturbations in the bulk water phase, both due to stochastic thermodynamic fluctuations (based on system temperature). Eventually, the number of guest molecules in an ordered arrangement exceeds that in the critical nucleus, leading to hydrate formation, characterized by guest-guest and host-guest order parameters near the hydrate phase.\n",

    "### <b> Types of Gas Hydrate Cage Recognition Algorithms</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Though clathrate hydrates have a vast array of applications, ranging from being a natural energy resource to CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration medium, several fundamental questions surrounding the formation, deformation and evolution of these structures remain unanswered. Due to both the scale and timescales associated with these structures, the only suitable method of investigation into their mechanisms is molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Within these investigations, cage recognition serves as a measure of formation, and thus nucleation, as well as stability, in relation to thermodynamics. Many groups have proposed and published varying recognition algorithms with varying working principals and use cases. The most prevalent among these are: FISCA, CHILL+, GRADE, Recognition by Guest, ICO and Cup Recognition Algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### FSICA Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The FISCA algorithm (and the variations thereof) work on the principal that a perfect polyhedron has edge and face saturation: each vertex joins at least three edges, and each edge connects two faces. Complete cages (CC) meet these conditions, while incomplete cages (IC) do not. Preceding ICA methods required existing methane molecules to identify surrounding cages. To overcome this limitation of ICA algorithms, Guo et al. devised the face-saturated incomplete cage analysis (FSICA) algorithm to identify complete cages (CC) and face-saturated incomplete cages (FSIC). In their seminal paper, FISCA was applied to water systems with H-bond networks in which there are both bonds and voids. Conceptually, the FISCA algorithm works by scanning entire H-bond network using a 3D mesh to find face-saturated cages. FSICA accurately identifies structures such as clusters of multiple hydrates and multi-guest molecular hydrates, which other algorithms can't achieve. While this algorithm can be used for both nucleation and core identification, it requires significant computing resources as well as a deep understanding of the target cage structure from implementation.\n",

    "\n",
    "Nguyen and Molinero developed the CHILL+ algorithm to identify cubic ice, hexagonal ice, clathrate hydrates, and liquids by analyzing staggered and overlapping water bonds. Unlike the original CHILL algorithm, which could only identify ice, CHILL+ was intedend as an extension to detect clathrate hydrates as well. The 3 categories of ice structure CHILL+ can identify all work based on patters in the number of staggered and eclipsed H-bonds. In cubic ice, each molecule forms four staggered bonds, while in hexagonal ice, three staggered bonds and one eclipsed bond are formed. Clathrate hydrates involve four eclipsed bonds per water molecule. Using these distinctions, CHILL+ can differentiate between ice and ice-like structures effectively though both the number of cages and their distribution in the system is required.\n",

    "#### GRADE Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Matsumoto's code, Jacobson et al. identified 5- and 6-membered water rings using a depth-first search (DFS) where water molecules are analogous vertices of an undirected graph. This ring identification is subject to several adaptable parameters dictating the convexity and planarity of the identified rings. Then the connectivity of each identified ring are to other nearby rings is determined. Using the established connections, a ring (5 or 6 membered) is selected as the base before other 5 membered rings connected to each of its edges are selected, constructing a so-called \"cup\". These cups are essentially halves of cages, referred to as 5<sup>6</sup> 6<sup>1</sup>5<sup>6</sup> cups. By merging cups, complete hydrate cages, like 5<sup>12</sup>, 6<sup>2</sup>5<sup>12</sup> and 6<sup>4</sup>5<sup>12</sup> cages, can be identified. Mahmoudinobar and Dias extended the ring identification proposed by Matsumoto and Jacobson to create GRADE, which can identify 5<sup>12</sup>, 6<sup>2</sup>5<sup>12</sup> and 6<sup>4</sup>5<sup>12</sup> cage structures using combinations of two 5<sup>6</sup>, two 6<sup>1</sup>5<sup>6</sup> or four 6<sup>1</sup>5<sup>6</sup> cups to form each cage respectively. A major advantage of the GRADE algorithm is that it's code is open source, however, it also benefits from providing more cage formation information due to its hierarchical approach as well as F4 parameter calculation functionality. However, GRADE's functionality was limited to the cages studied, thus limiting its recognition capacity.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recognition of Cages by Guest Molecules\n",
    "\n",
    "Lauricella et al. proposed a method to identify cages by searching for water molecules centered on guest molecules, subsequently avoiding the identification of empty cages. The group focused on only sI and sII types, identifying 5<sup>12</sup>, 5<sup>12</sup>6<sup>2</sup>, and 5<sup>12</sup>6<sup>4</sup> cages by finding 5- and 6-membered rings with Matsumoto's method. Then a modified Jacobson algorithm was used to merge these rings to form complete hydrate cages. As this approach uses guest molecules as a starting point, it effectively avoids empty cage defects.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### ICO Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, using the underlying method proposed by Jacobsen et al., Hao et al. proposed the Iterative Cup Overlap (ICO) algorithm to identify face-saturated cages by splicing cups. Each ring forms a cup with its adjacent ring, and by iteratively constructing cups topologically, complete cages are identified. This is done by using a ring as the base of a cup, before finding all the rings sharing an edge with this ring, referred to as \"primary rings\". Then each of the primary rings are used as a base ring and the same primary ring identification is carried out. The sets of primary rings between the first base and the primary rings used as bases are compared and the rings not common to both are stored as secondary rings. This sequential procedure essentially constructs the cup from only one starting cup rather than considering combinations of cups. Accordingly, this method can identify many cage types beyond 5<sup>12</sup>, 5<sup>12</sup>6<sup>2</sup>, and 5<sup>12</sup>6<sup>4</sup> with some adaptation.\n",

    "### HTR Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Liu et al. proposed the HTR algorithm to identify hydrate cages using ring topology, again improving on the cup structure method by Jacobson et al. The HTR algorithm begins with identifying a base ring, an upper and a lower cup which share the ring before uniquely localizing secondary rings to complete the cages using two hydrogen bonds from three adjacent water molecules (see figure below). Notably, this avoids repetitive identification and combination of cups resulting in the highest efficiency in identifying multiple cage types developed thus far.\n",
    "\n",
    "For complex hydrate structures where two rings can't form a unique topology, HTR performs topology calculations with one ring and then switches to another if needed. This ensures complete cage identification and prevents the reuse of rings already in a cage. HTR is highly efficient, especially for large-scale systems, as it introduces system splitting, reducing identification time from exponential to linear, making it suitable for studying hydrate micro-nano mechanics.\n",

    "The objective of the project was to create an easy-to-use implementation of the GRADE clathrate cage recognition algorithm. This new implementation aimed to be a more robust Python algorithm compared to the original C++ source code by Mahmoudinobar and Dias. The code should be easily extendable to different cage geometries and capable of recognizing various geometries, such as 5<sup>12</sup>, 6<sup>2</sup>5<sup>12</sup>, and 6<sup>4</sup>5<sup>12</sup> cages, using only .xyz file data in any order. The choice of .xyz file format was due to its widespread use in molecular modeling software, unlike the niche GROMAS (.gro) format used in the original paper. Additionally, the algorithm was designed to function as a Python module, utilizing an object-oriented approach to describe the network of water molecules as a graph object with structures as subclasses. Finally, it aimed to produce an output .xyz file of the identified cages for visualization."

    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "The overall approach to cage identification is similar to the method highlighted in the original GRADE paper though the implementation differs relatively significantly compared to the open source code provided by Mahmoudinobar and Dias. Namely, the code provided by the group is written in C++ and does not use an object-oriented approach, rather storing all cage recognition results in a series of floats, integers and vectors initialized toward the beginning of the code. The approach proposed below uses a single graph class, encapsulating all the search functions, result variables and other information in the class. This design choice was made to facilitate the implementation of depth first search and to allow for malleable searches to be carried out (e.g. only 5<sup>12</sup> cages or only 6<sup>2</sup>5<sup>12</sup> cages or both). Additionally, the method by which rings, cups and cages were all adapted to more efficient (where possible), more general and thus work with unordered .xyz files.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general use case of the GRADE implementation below runs as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "<b><u>Pre Processing:</u></b>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Read the .xyz file\n",
    "2. Separate the various trajectory time steps if necessary\n",
    "3. Store the .xyz file as a data frame using pd.read_csv() \n",
    "4. Segregate the Oxygen atoms from the Hydrogen atoms into two different data frames.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u><b> Initialization: </b></u>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make a Graph object and pass the Oxygen data frame as the argument\n",
    "2. In the constructor, the list of Oxygen atom data is used to create a Vertex subclass object for each atom before populating the vertices list.\n",
    "3. For each of the Vertex object created, the populate_neighbours() method is called to find the Oxygen atoms within a toleranced H-bond distance of the atom. These are stored in the neighbours set of the Vertex object.\n",
    "4. Other key variables used later are initialized including: a boolean closeable variable, two lists for the rings identified, the identified cups and the identified cages and several temporary placeholder variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the graph has been initialized, the find_all() graph method can be called to run every identification procedure built into the implementation of GRADE.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b><u>Execution:</u></b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Ring Finding:\n",
    "\n",
    "The ring finding procedure employs a depth first search algorithm of an undirected graph. Though unlike a traditional search algorithm which looks for node of a specific value, this search algorithm looks for a known pattern of nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The fiveDFSRingFinder(i, 0) Graph method can be called to start the ring finding. The i is for the index of the starting Vertex in the vertices list initialized earlier, with 0 as the search depth.\n",
    "2. The depth first search procedure is thus started, and will populate the temporary ring variable initialized earlier. This procedure is explained in detail later.\n",
    "3. The add_ring_to_matrix() method will then populate the permanent ring list (five_ring_list / six_ring_list) with the rings stored in the temporary variable.\n",
    "4. Each of the vertices is cleared of their search variables (visited and predecessor) using the clear() graph method.\n",
    "5. Steps 1-4 are repeated starting at each vertex for both the 5 and 6 membered ring depth first search procedures, populating the five and six membered ring lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neighbouring Rings:\n",
    "\n",
    "Before any cups can be found, the neighbouring rings must be identified. This is done for both the 6-membered rings neighbouring 5-membered rings and the 5-membered rings neighbouring other 5-membered rings. This is all the information required for all cups topologies except type H cups (not covered in this poject).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Call both the five_find_neighbouring_five_rings() and the six_find_neighbouring_five_rings() methods. This iterates over the rings of a respective list and makes pairwise comparisons to rings of another list.\n",
    "7. Each of the vertices of the pairs of rings are compared consecutively (ring vertices are stored in order) and if 2 molecules are common and consecutive in both rings, these rings are considered neighbours and the set variable, neighbouring_rings is updated as well as the coordination number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cup Finding:\n",
    "\n",
    "Cup finding leverages the ring neighbour information found previously, and an iterative depth first search procedure to find 6<sup>1</sup>5<sup>6</sup> and 5<sup>6</sup> cups.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Call the find_6_1_5_6_cups() or find_5_6_cups() graph methods. For each either 5- or 6-membered ring identified, loop through all the remaining 5-membered rings, using them as the starting node for the depth-first search. This search uses rings rather than nodes (explained in detail later).\n",
    "9. In the DFS procedure, checks are carried out at different search depths to find cups including duplicate cup, orientation and consistent neighbour checks. \n",
    "10. If a valid cup is found, it is added to either the cup_6_1_5_6_list or the cup_5_6_list before each of the rings is cleared of their search variables (visited and predecessor) using the clear() ring method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cage Finding:\n",
    "\n",
    "Cage finding works by comparing pairs of identified cups using several geometric constraints.\n",
    "\n",

    "The ring identification algorithm is takes a broadly similar approach to that of GRADE, though is different in some areas. Like GRADE, the DFS method checks for convexity and planarity, however, unlike GRADE, this implementation in recursive, object-oriented and perhaps more general than the open source code available. The key aspects of this crucial aspect of the entire cage identification method is highlighted in fiveDFSRingFinding() method. The only difference between the 5- and 6-membered ring finding methods are the convexity distance ratio, the interior angle value and the search depth at which the checks are carried out.\n",

    "\n",
    "The cup identification approach takes inspiration from the ring finding approach though, rather than using Vertex objects to conduct the DFS undirected graph search, rings are used instead. Essentially, we start with a base ring, then perform DFS to find a loop in the base ring's neighbouring rings subject to the constraint that each ring is oriented in the same direction. Accordingly, each Ring object contains the same predecessor and visited variables. Additionally, the DFS algorithm for the ring search is iterative rather than recursive and is set up to identify several cups from a single starting ring as this is common is hydrate structures. However, similar to the ring recognition DFS, the cup search has several checks at different search depths, essentially corresponding to the rings sharing an edge with the base ring which make up the cup. Again, rather than looking for a given node, we are looking for a pattern of nodes.\n",

The geometric aspects of this function relate to the orientation between cups (i.e., that they point in toward one another), and the distance separating their base centroids. These geometric checks help filter out invalid pairs of cups before the vertices of the rings of a cup are iterated through. As has been the theme with the entire algorithm thus far, this step is hierarchical meaning the function's ability to identify cages depends on the success of the cup identification method, in turn depending on ring finding. Thus, when tweaking algorithm constants, one should first adapt those pertaining to rings, then cups, then cages, to essentially calibrate the algorithm.

These include dist which calculates the distance between 2 atoms from rows of the dataframes defined above, inteded to help determine HBOND_DIST, HBOND_DIST_TOL, FIVE_RING_TOL and SIX_RING_TOL. the method angle_vec() is used to calculate the angle between a set of 3 vertices, using the central atom as the common point for the 2 vectors used to find the angle. This is useful when determining FIVE_ANGLE_TOL and SIX_ANGLE_TOL. The final method, angle_plane() finds the angle between sets of 4 vertices by determining planes from sets of 3 vertices (see the ring finding approach above for more details). This is useful when calculating PLANE_TILT_CUTOFF.\n",
