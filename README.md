# CHEE 494 - Individual Research Project and Seminar 
CHEE 494 Project Completed by Nicolas Smits (Summer 2024). 

The directory containing the final code of the project is 'DFS_Ring_Identification', with the jupyter notebook entitled 'DFS_Ring_Finder.ipynb' containing all of the code to run the DFS clarthrate hydrate cage identification procedure. The file in question contains extensive markdown explainations comprising the previous literature, the implementation procedure, and how to handle input and output .xyz files. Refer to this notebook for all details about the project.

Additonal example reference .xyz files of different types of cages, cages with different guest molecules, and larger collections of cage / interface structures are included in the reference_files directory which can be used as input files to the algorithm. Additonally, several output .xyz files are also included to demonstrate the identification results for different structures. The Ransac and Convex Hull directory include some alternative identification procedures investigated during the early researach stages of this project.
